The style for all PHP must follow the PSR-2 style: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/
Failing to do so will cause your Pull Request to be denied until fixed

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, create a new branch/fork and implement your feature there. Once you are finished with your modification/additions, submit a PR for review and merging into the official codebase.

Never accept your own PR. Require at least one person to review your code. This is to avoid possible security faults and bad coding styles.
